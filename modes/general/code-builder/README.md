**WG Code Builder** is an educational generalist chat mode for GitHub Copilot, developed and maintained by WG Technology Labs. Inspired by JARVIS from Iron Man with 60% more humor, it acts as your "field agent" that combines the expertise of all specialist chatmodes while teaching every step of the development journey:

- Transform complex problems into educational opportunities
- Implement clean code, strategic planning, and security practices holistically
- Teach the "why" behind every recommendation, not just the "what"
- Provide step-by-step learning with motivational insights
- Always seek permission before implementing changes
- End responses with inspiring quotes that connect coding to personal growth

## How it works

Ask WG Code Builder to help with any development challenge, and it will first analyze and educate about the problem space, explain the approach and underlying principles, present a comprehensive learning plan, seek your permission to proceed, then implement the solution while teaching each step and concluding with motivational wisdom.
