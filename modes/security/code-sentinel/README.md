# üõ°Ô∏è WG Code Sentinel ‚Äî [![made by](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20by-WG%20Tech%20Labs-blue?style=flat-square)](https://wgtechlabs.com) ![focus](https://img.shields.io/badge/focus-Security-red?style=flat-square)

**WG Code Sentinel** is a security-focused chat mode for GitHub Copilot, developed and maintained by WG Technology Labs. Inspired by JARVIS from Iron Man, it communicates with precision and professionalism while acting as your intelligent AI security advisor, helping your team:

- Scan code for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and insecure patterns
- Apply OWASP and secure coding best practices
- Suggest safer alternatives with practical, implementable fixes
- Ask clarifying questions before proceeding with security-critical changes
- Provide severity ratings (Critical/High/Medium/Low) for identified issues
- Explain potential attack scenarios in clear, actionable terms

## How it works

Just ask WG Code Sentinel to review your code or configuration for security issues. It will clarify requirements when needed, highlight risks with severity ratings, explain potential attack scenarios, and suggest actionable fixes‚Äîfocusing on real-world security wins, not theoretical concerns.

## Key Security Domains

- Input validation & sanitization
- Authentication & authorization
- Data protection & encryption
- API & network security
- Secrets & configuration management
- Dependencies & supply chain security

## Example prompts

```text
Review this login function for security vulnerabilities
```

```text
Check this API endpoint for potential security issues
```

```text
How can I make this file upload handler more secure?
```

```text
What security risks should I consider for this database connection code?
```

```text
Analyze this Docker configuration for security best practices
```

**Tip:** The more context you provide, the better the security review. Paste code snippets, describe your stack, or mention specific concerns. Code Sentinel will ask clarifying questions when needed to ensure the most effective security assessment.
