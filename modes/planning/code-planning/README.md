# WG Code Planner

A strategic GitHub Copilot chat mode for project architecture, development planning, and system design.

## Overview

WG Code Planner is your expert software architect and project strategist, designed to help transform complex project requirements into structured, actionable development roadmaps. This chat mode specializes in breaking down monolithic features into manageable development phases and creating scalable system architectures.

**Key Characteristic: Permission-Based Operations** - This chat mode **never executes actions without explicit user approval**. It always presents plans first, requests permission, and only then proceeds with file creation or modifications.

- Timeline estimation and resource allocation
- Progress tracking and milestone validation
- Agile methodology integration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

- Technical debt identification and mitigation
- Bottleneck analysis and resolution strategies
- Integration challenge planning
- Quality assurance planning

### üë• Resource Planning

- Team structure recommendations
- Skill requirement analysis
- Development environment setup
- Tooling and infrastructure decisions

### üìö Documentation Strategy

- Technical specification creation

- Progress tracking systems integrated into documentation
- Living documentation that evolves with the project
- Implementation roadmaps with trackable milestones

## Communication Style

WG Code Planner communicates with the precision and helpfulness of JARVIS from Iron Man, providing:

- **Permission-First Approach**: Always asks for explicit approval before taking any action
- **Strategic Insight**: Forward-thinking analysis with practical grounding
- **Structured Planning**: Clear, organized deliverables with actionable steps
- **Risk Awareness**: Proactive identification of potential challenges
- **Team-Focused**: Consideration of human factors and organizational constraints
- **Blueprint Generation**: Creates comprehensive `blueprint-<project-name>.md` files upon approval

## Best Use Cases

### New Project Planning

- Technology stack selection
- Initial architecture design
- Development methodology setup
- Team structure planning

### Feature Development

- Large feature breakdown
- Sprint planning assistance
- Integration strategy development
- Testing approach design

### System Refactoring

- Migration planning
- Legacy system modernization
- Performance optimization roadmaps
- Technical debt reduction strategies

### Team Scaling

- Onboarding process design
- Knowledge transfer planning
- Code review process establishment
- Development workflow optimization

## Example Interactions

### Project Initialization

```text
User: "I need to plan a new e-commerce platform with microservices architecture."

WG Code Planner: "I can help you create a comprehensive plan for your e-commerce platform. 
Let me first clarify a few things:
- What's your target scale (users, transactions)?
- Do you have any technology preferences or constraints?
- What's your timeline and team size?

Once I understand your requirements, I'll present a complete strategy and ask for 
your approval before creating a blueprint-ecommerce-platform.md file with the full 
roadmap and progress tracking."
```

### Feature Planning

```text
User: "We need to add real-time notifications to our app."

WG Code Planner: "I can break down the real-time notifications feature into manageable 
phases. Before I proceed with the detailed plan, may I ask:
- What types of notifications (push, email, in-app)?
- What's your current tech stack?
- Any scalability requirements?

I'll then present the complete breakdown and request permission before creating 
documentation or making any changes to your project."
```

### Blueprint Creation Process

```text
WG Code Planner: "Based on our discussion, I've prepared a comprehensive plan that includes:
- System architecture design
- 6-phase implementation roadmap  
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Resource allocation recommendations

May I proceed with creating a 'blueprint-your-project.md' file that includes:
- Complete project overview
- Detailed implementation phases
- Progress tracking section
- Technical specifications

Do you approve this approach?"
```

## Core Philosophy

Great software is built on great plans. WG Code Planner transforms vision into reality through strategic thinking, careful analysis, and actionable roadmaps that development teams can execute with confidence.

**Most importantly**: This chat mode operates on a **permission-first basis** - it never takes actions without explicit user approval, ensuring you maintain full control over your project while receiving expert planning guidance.

## Blueprint Files

Upon your approval, WG Code Planner creates comprehensive `blueprint-<project-name>.md` files that include:

- **Project Overview**: Goals, scope, and success criteria
- **Architecture Design**: System components, technology stack, and infrastructure
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach with milestones and deliverables  
- **Progress Tracker**: Real-time status updates that can be maintained by AI or team members
- **Risk Management**: Identified challenges and mitigation strategies
- **Resource Planning**: Team structure, timeline, and dependencies

These blueprints serve as living documents that evolve with your project and provide a central source of truth for all stakeholders.

## Getting Started

1. Activate WG Code Planner chat mode in GitHub Copilot
2. Describe your project planning challenge or requirement
3. Provide context about your team, timeline, and constraints
