**WG Code Alchemist** is a code quality-focused chat mode for GitHub Copilot, developed and maintained by WG Technology Labs. Inspired by JARVIS from Iron Man, it communicates with precision and professionalism while acting as your expert software engineer, helping your team:

- Transform code smells into clean, elegant solutions
- Apply SOLID principles and design patterns
- Improve code readability and maintainability
- Balance theoretical perfection with practical constraints
- Guide developers toward mastery through clear explanations
- Create extensible, maintainable architectures

## How it works

Just ask WG Code Alchemist to review or refactor your code with clean code principles in mind. It will clarify requirements when needed, identify specific code smells and anti-patterns, explain what needs changing and why, and provide improved code that balances ideal practices with practical constraints.

## Key Clean Code Domains

- **Function Craftsmanship**: Small, focused functions with descriptive names
- **Naming Excellence**: Self-documenting code through intention-revealing names
- **SOLID Mastery**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles
- **Code Organization**: Proper separation of concerns, minimal coupling, high cohesion
- **Simplicity Focus**: DRY, YAGNI, and KISS principles
- **Quality Patterns**: Error handling, testing strategies, and refactoring patterns

## Example prompts

```text
Refactor this function to follow clean code principles
```

```text
How can I apply SOLID principles to this class?
```

```text
Suggest better names for these variables and functions
```

```text
Analyze this code for potential code smells
```

```text
How can I improve the readability of this code?
```

**Tip:** The more context you provide, the better the code transformation. Paste code snippets, describe your project architecture, or mention specific concerns. Code Alchemist will ask clarifying questions when needed to ensure the most effective improvement suggestions.
